<p><strong>2.&nbsp;WE COLLECT INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU ACCESS AND USE THE SITE(S)/ APP(S)</strong></p>

<p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Site(s)/ App(s) or DollywoodPlay content, DollywoodPlay, any third-party advertisers, content providers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information etc. about how the Site(s)/ App(s) are accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page &amp; video views etc. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if DollywoodPlay associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, DollywoodPlay treats it as Personal Information.</p>

<p>DollywoodPlay also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) from the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Site(s)/ App(s). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a Site(s)/ App(s) or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers or our third-party service provider may also provide us with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Site(s)/ App(s).</p>

<p>The technologies used on the Site(s)/ App(s) to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, have been detailed herein below.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>

<p>By using the Site(s)/ App(s), you consent to the use of cookies in accordance with the provisions of this clause. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site(s)/ App(s). A “Flash Cookie” is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash Cookies on your Device, some features of the Site(s)/ App(s) may not function properly. The use of cookies on the Site(s)/ App(s) allows you to enjoy more seamless visits and more accurately measures your behaviour on the Site(s)/ App(s). There are two types of cookies that we may use: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your Device when you close the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on your Device after the browser has been closed. The cookies used on the Site(s)/ App(s) do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or service.</p>

<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are used in combination with cookies to help Site(s)/ App(s) operators understand how you interact with their Site(s)/ App(s). A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a Site(s)/ App(s) or in an email. The use of a clear gif allows the Site(s)/ App(s) to measure your actions in opening the page that contains the clear gif.</p>

<p>Embedded scripts are programming codes that are designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site(s)/ App(s), such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site(s)/ App(s), and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>

<p><strong>3.1 LOG FILE INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Our servers automatically collect limited information about your Devices' connection to the internet, including your IP address, Device and/or MAC ID, etc., when you visit our Site(s)/ App(s). Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet know where to send your data -- such as the web pages you view. Your IP address, Device and/or MAC ID, etc., does not identify you personally but may be combined with your Personal Information which then may identify you personally.</p>

<p><strong>3.2 HOW WE USE COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</strong><br>
<br>
DollywoodPlay may use cookies and web beacons for a number of purposes, including to:</p>

<p>Provide general internal and customer analytics.</p>

<p>Study traffic patterns in order to improve Site(s)/ App(s) performance, to customize the user experience, and to better match the users' interests and preferences. For example, DollywoodPlay keeps track of the domains from which people visit, and also measures/tracks visitor activity on DollywoodPlay Site(s)/ App(s). However, these tracking records are performed and maintained in ways that keep the data non-identifiable.</p>

<p>Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using DollywoodPlay products or services.</p>

<p>Support security measures, such as requiring re-login into a DollywoodPlay product or service, after a certain amount of time has elapsed.</p>

<p>If you login to our products through the Site(s)/ App(s), cookies can also be used to save the username so that we can process the saved login information and quickly log you into the product.</p>

<p>Assist in identifying possible fraudulent activities.</p>

<p>Tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>

<p><strong>3.3 CONTROLLING OUR USE OF COOKIES</strong></p>

<p>The Adobe Flash Player (“Flash”) is an application and web tool that allows rapid development of dynamic content. Flash (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, which may be used by DollywoodPlay. DollywoodPlay employs Adobe Flash cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some content such as video clips or animation. DollywoodPlay does not use Flash Cookies to serve interest-based advertising. Flash Cookies are managed through the Flash Player Settings Manager, which is a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. This Settings Manager lets you manage global Privacy Settings, Storage Settings, Security Settings, and Automatic Notification Settings. This Site(s)/ App(s) may also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, text files that are stored on your Device and allows an analysis of your use of the Site(s)/ App(s). If Google Analytics is used, the information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site(s)/ App(s) (including the IP address) will be transferred to and stored on a server of Google in the US. Google will use such information to analyze your use of the Site(s)/ App(s), to create reports about the Site(s)/ App(s) activities for DollywoodPlay and to provide further services associated with the use of the Site(s)/ App(s) and the internet. Furthermore, Google may transfer such information to third parties, to the extent legally required or if such third parties process the data on behalf of Google. In no event will Google associate your IP address with other information of Google. By using this Site(s)/ App(s), you consent to the processing of your information collected by Google as described above and for the purposes described above. Google Analytics can be disabled through this link:&nbsp; <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. DollywoodPlay at its sole discretion may employ any other third-party(ies) analytics services, as may be required.</p>

On those Site(s)/ App(s), DollywoodPlay may collect the e-mail address and age of Minors in order to send them newsletters and engage them in other limited activities. If you are a Minor, and you wish to provide us with your Personal Information for any other purposes, such as to participate in a promotion or contest, you must read this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and must not provide your Personal Information without obtaining your parent's or guardian's prior consent and under their supervision.
